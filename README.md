# NASDAQ Sharpe Ratio


The Sharpe Ratio is an indicator developped by William Sharpe (a Nobel Price in Economic Sciences). It aim to answer the question : can we obtain a performance superior to a risk-free investment, and can we do it at a lesser risk ?

The formula is the following : Sharpe Ratio (S.R) = (R-s)/σ with R the portfolio expected return, r the benchmark expected return (S&P 500, Nasdaq, government bonds), and σ the standard deviation of the average portfolio return (the daily volatility, or the risk associated with the investment). Basically, it tells you whether the good perfomance of a portfolio is due to sound money management, or excessive risk-taking.

If S.R < 0 : the portfolio performance is worse than the risk-free alternative (R < r) If 0 < S.R < 1 : the risk is too high compared to the return rate obtained (R > r but R-s < σ) Of S.R > 1 : the portfolio return rate outperform the index without additional risk (R > r and R-s > σ)
