# NASDAQ Sharpe Ratio


The Sharpe Ratio is an indicator developped by William Sharpe (a Nobel Price in Economic Sciences). It aims to answer the question : can we attain a performance superior to a risk-free investment, and can we do it at a lesser risk ?

The formula is the following : Sharpe Ratio (S.R) = (R-s)/σ with R the portfolio average return, r the benchmark average return (S&P 500, Nasdaq, government bonds), and σ the standard deviation of the portfolio return (the daily volatility, measuring the risk of the investment). 
Basically, it tells you whether the good perfomance of a portfolio is due to sound money management, or excessive risk-taking.

If S.R < 0 : the portfolio performance is worse than the risk-free alternative (R < r)
If 0 < S.R < 1 : the risk is too high compared to the return rate obtained (R > r but R-s < σ)
If S.R > 1 : the portfolio outperforms the index without additional risk (R > r and R-s > σ)
